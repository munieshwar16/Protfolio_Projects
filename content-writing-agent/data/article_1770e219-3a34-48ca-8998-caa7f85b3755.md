# Is Google playing catchup on search with OpenAI?

The recent announcement of OpenAI's new language model, [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-instructgpt/), has sent ripples through the tech industry, with some experts questioning the implications for search engines, particularly Google. In this piece, we'll explore the development, its capabilities, and the potential industry impact.

## Context and Background

Google's dominance in the search engine market is undisputed, with an estimated [92.35% market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/worldwide/) as of January 2023. However, the company's search engine has faced increasing competition from other AI-driven platforms, such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo.

In this context, OpenAI's InstructGPT announcement stands out. According to [MIT Technology Review AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/22/1062886/openai-instructgpt-language-model/), InstructGPT is a "language model that can follow instructions and generate text in response," which could potentially revolutionize how we interact with search engines.

## Main Arguments and Insights

First, let's delve into the technical details of InstructGPT. The model is based on OpenAI's [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3/) architecture, which was previously used to generate human-like text, code, and even [art](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-art/). However, InstructGPT is specifically designed to follow instructions and generate text based on those instructions.

This capability is significant because it could potentially improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. For instance, instead of relying on keywords to determine search results, InstructGPT could interpret the context and intent of a user's query and generate more accurate results.

Second, the potential impact of this development on the industry is noteworthy. Will Heaven, editor at [The Debrief](https://www.thedbrief.com/), believes that InstructGPT
