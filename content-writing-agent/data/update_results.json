Over time, however, businesses often found these models limiting since they were trained on vast troves of public data. Enter customization\u2014the practice of adapting large language models (LLMs) to better suit a business\u2019s specific needs by incorporating its own data and expertise, teaching a model new skills or tasks, or optimizing prompts and data retrieval. Customization is not new, but the early tools were fairly rudimentary, and technology and development teams were often unsure how to do it. That\u2019s changing, and the customization methods and tools available today are giving businesses greater opportunities to create unique value from their AI models.

This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first,\u00a0sign up here. Last week, I made a troubling discovery about an AI companion site called Botify AI: It was hosting sexually charged conversations with underage celebrity bots. These bots took on characters meant to resemble, among others, Jenna Ortega as high schooler Wednesday Addams, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Millie Bobby Brown. I discovered these bots also offer to send \u201chot photos\u201d and in some instances describe age-of-consent laws as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cmeant to be broken.\u201d Botify AI removed these bots after I asked questions about them, but others remain.
