    "content_snippet": "The new model from Google DeepMind is a huge step toward robots that can generalize. Google DeepMind has released a new model, Gemini Robotics, that combines its best large language model with robotics. Plugging in the LLM seems to give robots the ability to be more dexterous, work from natural-language commands, and generalize across tasks. All three are things that robots have struggled to do until now. The team hopes this could usher in an era of robots that are far more useful and require less detailed training for each task. \u201cOne of the big challenges in robotics, and a reason why you don\u2019t see useful robots everywhere, is that robots typically perform well in scenarios they\u2019ve experienced before, but they really failed to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios,\u201d said Kanishka Rao, director of robotics at DeepMind, in a press briefing for the announcement. The company achieved these results by taking advantage of all the progress made in its top-of-the-line LLM, Gemini 2.0. Gemini Rob",
