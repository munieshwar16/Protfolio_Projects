Over time, however, businesses often found these models limiting since they were trained on vast troves of public data. Enter customization\u2014the practice of adapting large language models (LLMs) to better suit a business\u2019s specific needs by incorporating its own data and expertise, teaching a model new skills or tasks, or optimizing prompts and data retrieval. Customization is not new, but the early tools were fairly rudimentary, and technology and development teams were often unsure how to do it. That\u2019s changing, and the customization methods and tools available today are giving businesses greater opportunities to create unique value from their AI models.

This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first,\u00a0sign up here. Last week, I made a troubling discovery about an AI companion site called Botify AI: It was hosting sexually charged conversations with underage celebrity bots. These bots took on characters meant to resemble, among others, Jenna Ortega as high schooler Wednesday Addams, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Millie Bobby Brown. I discovered these bots also offer to send \u201chot photos\u201d and in some instances describe age-of-consent laws as \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cmeant to be broken.\u201d Botify AI removed these bots after I asked questions about them, but others remain.

Over time, however, businesses often found these models limiting since they were trained on vast troves of public data. Enter customization\u2014the practice of adapting large language models (LLMs) to better suit a business\u2019s specific needs by incorporating its own data and expertise, teaching a model new skills or tasks, or optimizing prompts and data retrieval. Customization is not new, but the early tools were fairly rudimentary, and technology and development teams were often unsure how to do it. That\u2019s changing, and the customization methods and tools available today are giving businesses greater opportunities to create unique value from their AI models.

Over time, however, businesses often found these models limiting since they were trained on vast troves of public data. Enter customization\u2014the practice of adapting large language models (LLMs) to better suit a business\u2019s specific needs by incorporating its own data and expertise, teaching a model new skills or tasks, or optimizing prompts and data retrieval. Customization is not new, but the early tools were fairly rudimentary, and technology and development teams were often unsure how to do it. That\u2019s changing, and the customization methods and tools available today are giving businesses greater opportunities to create unique value from their AI models.

While impressive in controlled demos, today\u2019s AI technologies expose critical limitations when transitioning to production-ready games, said Kylan Gibbs, CEO of Inworld AI, in an interview with GamesBeat. Right now, AI deployment is being slowed because game developers are dependent on black-box APIs with unpredictable pricing and shifting terms, leading to a loss of autonomy and stalled innovation, he said. Players are left with disposable \u201cAI-flavored\u201d demos instead of sustained, evolving experiences. At the Game Developers Conference 2025, Inworld isn\u2019t going to showcase technology for technology\u2019s sake.

But when I talked to Will about this, he said, \u201cit almost feels like a lack of imagination, right?\u201d Yeah. It does.

Google DeepMind has released a new model, Gemini Robotics, that combines its best large language model with robotics. Plugging in the LLM seems to give robots the ability to be more dexterous, work from natural-language commands, and generalize across tasks. All three are things that robots have struggled to do until now. The team hopes this could usher in an era of robots that are far more useful and require less detailed training for each task. \u201cOne of the big challenges in robotics, and a reason why you don\u2019t see useful robots everywhere, is that robots typically perform well in scenarios they\u2019ve experienced before, but they really failed to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios,\u201d said Kanishka Rao, director of robotics at DeepMind, in a press briefing for the announcement.
